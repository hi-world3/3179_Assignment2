    <h1><strong>Victoria's Demographic Trends: A Visual Analysis (2011-2023)</strong></h1>
    <p>This visualisation explores how population changes due to births and deaths have manifested across Victoria's 
      Local Government Areas (LGAs) from 2011 to 2023.<br>We will examine which areas are growing naturally, which are aging, and
      explore the potential reasons why through the data.</p>

    <h2>Where is the Population Growing or Declining?</h2>
    <p>The map below illustrates the 'natural increase' for each LGA. Use the slider to explore the data for a specific year.

        <h3>Key Observations and Summaries</h3>
        <p>In 2023, a clear pattern emerges across Greater Melbourne. The metropolitan fringe areas, particularly in the 
          <strong>fast-growing western and northern corridors</strong>, exhibit a high natural increase, likely linked to housing affordability.<br> In contrast, many established <strong>eastern suburbs are experiencing a natural decrease</strong>.<br>
        Comparing 2023 to a decade prior reveals a significant demographic shift across the state. Many regional areas that showed natural growth in 2013 have now shifted to a natural decrease, a trend particularly evident in the <strong>Mornington Peninsula</strong>.</p>

    <h2>What is the Overall trend for Victoria? (2011 to 2023)</h2>

        <h3>Key Observations and Summaries</h3>
        <p>Victoria's births <strong>peaked around 2016 and have declined</strong> since, while deaths have consistently trended upwards. This rise in deaths accelerated sharply from 2020, a trend likely influenced by the<strong> COVID-19 pandemic </strong>, before a slight drop in 2023.</p>

      2023 scatter plot: Median age (x) vs. births (y) by LGA; dot size reflects socio-economic status via the 2021 Census IRSD—larger dots, where a higher score represents a higher advantage of socio-economic growth.

        <h3>Key Observations and Summaries</h3>
        <p>
         Overall, the chart shows a clear pattern: <strong>LGAs with lower median age have more births</strong>, aligning with the map’s high-growth “blue” areas as predominantly younger communities. Dot size adds nuance—LGAs with the most births (e.g., Casey, Hume) aren’t necessarily the most socio-economically advantaged, indicating that<strong> rapid birth-driven growth is concentrated in younger, developing outer-suburban corridors</strong> rather than the most affluent areas.

  <h2>Where in Victoria has more births or deaths and why?</h2>
  <p>
    On the right, the Population Pyramid shows the underlying demographic structure of two contrasting areas: <strong>Casey</strong>(high-birth) vs <strong>Mornington Peninsula</strong>(high death).

        <h3>Key Observations and Summaries</h3>
        <p>The Top 10 chart shows that births are highest in outer growth areas like Casey, while deaths are highest in established coastal areas like the Mornington Peninsula. 
          <br>The population pyramid explains why: Casey has a <strong>classic pyramid shape</strong> that is wider at the bottom, reflecting a young population structure, while Mornington Peninsula has a<strong>top-heavy, aging structure</strong>. 
          <br>This means Victoria's population trends are simply a geographical map of its<strong>young and old communities</strong>.
